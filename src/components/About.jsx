          Hello, I’m a Creative Developer who blends clean interfaces,
          expressive visuals, and intuitive interactions to build digital
          experiences that feel intentional and human.
        </p>
        <p>
          From custom WordPress builds to fully designed front-end experiences,
          I focus on turning ideas into thoughtful, usable, and
          visually-driven solutions. Every project is a chance to explore,
          experiment, and create something that not only works—but feels good
          to use.
        </p>
      </div>
